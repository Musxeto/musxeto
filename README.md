# **yo!**

This is my corner of the internet. I'm Musxeto (he/him), a programmer by day and sleeper by night (aka xetopher, lil mussi w, mus). I'm a CS sophomore at Lahore Garrison University and an aspiring full-stack developer.

## What I'm into:
- Building sick web apps with React.js and Firebase
- Flexing my Python and C++ skills
- Conquering Data Structures and Algorithms like a boss (DSA gang wya?)
- Learning new stuff every day - that's the dev life, baby!

## Check out my projects:
- **Berserk Fit**: An e-commerce platform for gym enthusiasts to get ripped (React.js, Firebase)
- **ArcadeOS**: A bootable operating system for the OG gamers (Assembly language - y'all know I love it!)
- **Chikimus**: An anime quote generator for all the weebs out there (React.js, HTML, CSS)
